I managed to get something up on Heroku!

----------------------

This past Friday, we built our first app that actually functions in a browser. It allows you to enter some text, save it to a database, and view all 
the entries in that database. For some reason I had a rough time putting this on Heroku on Friday, but today I had no problems. 
[Here's](http://www.blacktm.com/talks/building_web_apps_with_rack_and_sinatra#messages) the original assignment. The files come with enough code to get you 
started, but leave enough out to require some thinking.

See my first lil appy [here](http://laura-messages.herokuapp.com/)!
